Introduction
------------
This is a command-line version of [750 Words](http://750words.com/). I really like the idea of writing 750 words daily, but I don't like the idea of having all of my words on someone else's server. I also wanted to write my 750 words in Vim, with Git version control.

Therefore, I wrote this script. You get all the benefits of writing 750 words daily, within the comfort of your preferred text editor. You also get the peace-of-mind that comes with having your words as tangible plain-text files on your on machine, tracked with Git. You don't (yet) get the cool analysis features that are on the 750 words website, but this is something that I would like to improve.

Installation
------------
Clone the repository, and execute:

        $ sudo python setup.py install

Or whatever you do to install Python scripts on your machine.

If you want version control with Git, you're going to want to install that as well.

Configuration
-------------
There are only two things to configure: which editor to use, and where to store your words.

To set the editor:

    750words config -e vim

To set the output directory:

    750words config -o ~/Dropbox/docs/journal/

Usage
-----
Every day, type `750words` and type at least 750 words. You'll experience major improvements in creativity and a clear mind.

Here's the full output of `750words -h`:

        usage: 750words [-h] {wc,log,edit,cat,path,analyze,config} ...

        positional arguments:
          {wc,log,edit,cat,path,analyze,config}
            analyze             view analysis
            cat                 cat the text
            config              modify or view configuration
            edit                edit the text
            log                 print the git log
            path                get the path to the text file
            wc                  view word count

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Have fun!

Examples
--------
To see how much you wrote in August 2011:

    750words wc $(dirname $(750words path))/2011-08-*.txt

This is using 750words' built-in word count analyzer, which counts contractions like "don't" as two words. This is slower than just searching by spaces, so, alternatively:

    wc -w $(dirname $(750words path))/2011-08-*.txt
